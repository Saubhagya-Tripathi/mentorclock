# 🕒 MentorClock

**MentorClock** is a simple and powerful time zone conversion tool built for mentors and managers working with students across the U.S., while operating from India or other international locations.

This tool helps you:
- Convert mentor session times (entered in IST) to student time zones (as per Lumos dashboard).
- Instantly get the **mentor’s reporting time** in the designated U.S. time zone (mostly Eastern Time, but customizable).
- Eliminate confusion around U.S. daylight saving changes, different states, and regional time zone formats.

## ✅ Why This Tool Exists

Managing sessions across multiple time zones — especially in the U.S. where different states follow different DST rules — can be a challenge.  
MentorClock simplifies the process by giving you a **clear and accurate conversion** of:

- **Mentor's local time** (IST or any given time)
- → to the **Student's timezone**
- → and then to the **Mentor Reporting Time** (e.g., Eastern Time as per company standards)

---

## 🔧 How to Use

1. **Enter the session time** in IST (mentor's local time).
2. **Select the student's time zone** (based on your Lumos dashboard — options like `America/Chicago`, `America/New_York`, etc.).
3. **Select your reporting time zone** (like `Eastern time - US & Canada` or `Pacific time - US & Canada`).
4. Click the **"Get Mentor Times"** button.
5. Get clear output in **12-hour format** (e.g., `5:30 PM`) for both:
   - Student’s local time
   - Mentor’s reporting time (formatted exactly as per your selected label)
